# os-tutorial
A tutorial for writing your own operating system.

I was writing my own operating system/minikernel thing using cfenollosa/os-tutorial.  However, the tutorial was last updated about 5 years ago, and many people have been asking for it to be continued.  I'm going to try to do that here.

I am going to use most of the content of the original tutorial, and then add things like storage drivers myself, while improving upon the original.

## To-do list:

- [ ] Basic bootloader (not grub)
- [ ] 32-bit mode
- [ ] Move from assembly to C
- [ ] Screen output
- [ ] Tiny libc
- [ ] Keyboard input
- [ ] Floppy drivers
- [ ] FAT12 support
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Simple shell

and possibly more once these have been completed
