# Lesson 0: Environment Setup

You are going to need a few tools to complete this project

First, try to run Linux, as it is easier to deal with all of the tools.

If you can't, Mac works fine, it will just be slightly more difficult.  And if you are running Windows, it will be easiest to install WSL.

For the bootloader, all you will need is nasm (if you're on Mac, don't use the Xcode's built in nasm, use one from brew or another source).

When we switch to C, you will need a cross compiler, but we will cover that in another chapter.
